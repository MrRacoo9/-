           <font size="4px"> <b><li>For the dough, you need to take oil at room temperature.<br></li>
            It is best if you take it out of the refrigerator in advance.<br>
            I wouldn't recommend warming cold oil in the microwave.<br>
            for part of it will quickly melt, while the other remains cold and hard.<br>
 <br>
 <li>Soft butter should be rubbed with sugar. You can use a fork<br></il>
    but why spend a lot of effort if there is a mixer. <br>
    Whisk butter and sugar at low speed until smooth and fluffy.<br>
       <br>
    <li>Beat eggs. I have an average size of eggs, about 65 g with a shell.<br>
        Again, at low speed of the mixer, beat the dough.</li>
         <br>
       <li>Pour milk into the dough. It should be fresh, not sour, and preferably not too cold.<br>
        Whisk again. Try to do everything at low speeds, <br>
        so that the mass does not scatter from the bowl.<br></li>
           <br>
           <li>Squeeze the juice into a tablespoon and pour into the dough.<br></li>
           <br>
           <li>Sift the required amount of flour there with the addition of baking powder.</li>
           Stir with either a spoon or the whisk of a mixer.<br>
           <br>
           
           <li>The dough for this recipe should be smooth, uniform,<br>
            as thick as pancakes.<br>
         <br>
         <li>Grease the waffle iron with a drop of vegetable oil with a culinary brush,<br>
            warm up the appliance well.</li><br>
            <br>
            <li>Put the dough in the middle of the mold and close the waffle iron tightly.
                One waffle requires approximately 2 tablespoons of dough.</li><br>
            <br>
             <li> Bake Viennese waffles for about 5 minutes, but the baking time for each model of waffle iron will be different.
                
                Therefore, control the browning of the waffles. My waffles took about 5 minutes to bake.<br>
                From this amount of dough, I prepared 10 wafers measuring 10 * 10 cm.</li><br> 
            <br>
            <center><img src="Венгерские вафли 1.jpg" alt="result" height="400" width="500"></li></center>
            <br>
            <em> Let me share one trick.</em>. Immediately after baking, the waffles are crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.<br>
            But as soon as they lie down for a little more than an hour, the waffles become soft,<br>
            and that delicious crispy crust is gone.<br>
            To keep waffles crispy, I recommend putting them on a wire rack before serving.<br>
            (can be on a baking sheet) and dry in the oven at a temperature of 160 degrees for 4-5 minutes. <br>
            Such waffles will be crispy again, even on the second day.<br>
            
             <br>
            
            <li> Serve them warm - it tastes so much better. But they are good cold too.<br>
                There are quite a few ways to submit.</li><br></b></font>
